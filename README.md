# Eat-Sleep-Coffee-Code
### C# on the .NET Core, Console Application
Console Application displaying a typical coding cycle for me and really only meant to be a warmup for the day. The cycle isn't performed in any particular order for any specified amount of time. I created the desktop background from the code used in this repo. Feel free to add stuff to this repo as you see fit. It has no destination, except for the fact that it doesn't have a destination is the destination.
